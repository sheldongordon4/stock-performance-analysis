# Stock Performance Analysis - Tesla & GameStop

In this project, you take on the role of a Data Analyst/Data Scientist working for a startup investment firm. Your task is to extract and analyze stock market and revenue data for two popular companies — **Tesla** and **GameStop** — to help identify investment opportunities and trends.

### Project Overview
The goal is to use Python to collect **historical stock prices** and **quarterly revenue reports**, clean and process the data, and create a **dashboard for visualization**. This enables tracking of company performance over time and identifying potential signals for investment strategies.

### Data Sources
- **Stock Prices**: Extracted using the yfinance Python library
- **Quarterly Revenue Data**: Extracted via **web scraping** from official company sites or financial data aggregators

### Tools & Technologies
- Python
- JupyterLab Notebook
- Libraries: yfinance, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Cleaned revenue data: removed currency symbols, commas, and other non-numeric characters
- Merged stock and revenue data for side-by-side visualization

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Created an interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze:
- Historical Stock Price Trends
- Quarterly Revenue Trends
- Price vs. Revenue Overlays
- Comparison between Tesla and GameStop

### Results & Insights
- Visual trends show Tesla's consistent **revenue growth** and **stock price increase**, with notable jumps after quarterly reports.
- GameStop’s revenue and stock price show **high volatility**, with some spikes likely influenced by **external market events** (e.g., meme stock movement).
- The dashboard provides a user-friendly way to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualize correlations over time.
